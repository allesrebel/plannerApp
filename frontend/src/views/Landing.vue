        <template #heading>A Neato Frontend w/ Vue</template>
        <p>That uses the backend we wrote earlier</p>
        <p>
            Decided to reuse the styling done by Vue's tutorial (it's neat too!)
        </p>
        <p>
            Not just that though, reused some of the modal code too. It works
            great!
